# About

I was taking a LinkedIn skill assessment, and as unbelievable as it may seem, I didn't pass the test.

So, I thought: Who is the better programmer? Is it someone who can answer some silly questions and pass a test, or is it someone who can use technology to pass in every test?

Therefore, I built this robot...

It logs into LinkedIn, go to skill assessments and utilizes ChatGPT to find the correct answers.


## How to get an Access Token?

You can manually get an accessToken by logging in to the ChatGPT webapp and then opening https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session, which will return a JSON object containing your accessToken string.
